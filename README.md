An Enlightened Decentralized Voting App in the Ethereum Blockchain using Distributed Systems V1


The Decentralized Internet is Our Constitutional and Global Right, let's navigate through the future of 5G and Web3!s


Required:
> Truffle Framework- For Establishing a Smart Contract, expedites development on the Ether, contains automated testing and a configureable build pipeline
> npm install -g truffle

>Ganache: Graphical User Interface that displays transaction history and current chain state
>ganache-cli :Command Line tool for Truffle Blockchain Server

Blockchain and React.js


Init: Create Default Smart Contract and Tests
> truffle init
1. truffle compile
2. truffle migrate -deploy contract to network
3. truffle test

>open the Ganache and it will begin the blockchain instance, create a witty name for the workspace like I did. 
>use a typical create-react-app, but with a truffle folder
4. truffle migrate --reset

If you wish to get a domain name and hose this, you have to use ENS and buy a decentralized domain name, to be hosted by the peer to peer net.

5. Configure Metamask-import an account node from Ganache with their public hash. 

6. npm run dev 
>just like a standard react app on the client side, 
>Voting with truth, without the bullshits.

Remember to Send It.

I got the foundation of this project from dAppUniversity, they host a series of free, open-source tutorials on Blockchain, and I plan to expand this with React. 

will be releasing a series of posts in the coming months, and add a dedicated PWA Site to Project Red Ether. This is just a beginning...
